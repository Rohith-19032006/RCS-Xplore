      <h2>Origin of Vijayanagara Dynasty</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, in the early 14th century, the Deccan plateau witnessed a remarkable uprising. Amidst the turmoil caused by invasions from the Delhi Sultanate, two brothers—Harihara and Bukka—stood tall. Formerly commanders of the fallen Kampili kingdom, their fate took a dramatic turn when they were captured, converted, and later reclaimed their roots with the guidance of sage Vidyaranya. In 1336 CE, they established the Vijayanagara Empire along the banks of the Tungabhadra, envisioning a citadel of dharma, culture, and resistance to foreign domination.</p>

    <section id="dynasties">
      <h2>Dynasties of Vijayanagara Empire</h2>
      <p>The story of Vijayanagara unfolds through four powerful dynasties—each with its own legends and challenges. The Sangama Dynasty laid the groundwork. Then came the Saluva and Tuluva dynasties, whose brave kings and visionary administrators expanded and beautified the empire. The final chapter was penned by the Aravidu Dynasty, who held onto power despite overwhelming odds.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sangama Dynasty</strong> (1336–1485): Founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I</li>
        <li><strong>Saluva Dynasty</strong> (1485–1505): Saluva Narasimha took power to save the empire</li>
        <li><strong>Tuluva Dynasty</strong> (1505–1570): The greatest period under Krishnadevaraya</li>
        <li><strong>Aravidu Dynasty</strong> (1570–1646): Last dynasty after Battle of Talikota</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="policies">
      <h2>Administrative and Cultural Policies</h2>
      <p>Vijayanagara was more than a military power. It was a cultural lighthouse. The rulers established robust governance systems, ensured food security, promoted multilingual scholarship, and fostered peace across communities. Their forward-thinking policies helped transform a kingdom into an empire that became the envy of the world.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promoted agriculture through irrigation canals (e.g., Deva Raya’s projects)</li>
        <li>Encouraged trade with Persia, Portugal, and Arabia</li>
        <li>Patronized Hindu temples but were tolerant of Jainism and Islam</li>
        <li>Supported classical literature in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="visitors">
      <h2>Foreign Visitors and Records</h2>
      <p>The fame of Vijayanagara traveled far. From Venice to Persia, travelers chronicled its splendor. They painted vivid pictures of markets filled with gems, parades of elephants, and towering fortresses guarding golden temples. These were not myths, but eyewitness records that astonish historians even today.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Niccolò de' Conti</strong> (Italy): Described a rich capital with busy markets</li>
        <li><strong>Abdur Razzaq</strong> (Persia): Compared Hampi to world-class cities of his time</li>

    <section id="downfall">
      <h2>Downfall of the Empire</h2>
      <p>Every glorious tale has a tragic end. The Battle of Talikota in 1565 marked the fall of a legend. The death of Aliya Rama Raya led to chaos. Hampi was looted, its temples destroyed, and its legacy scattered in ruins. Though the Aravidu Dynasty lingered on, the empire’s soul had been crushed—leaving behind only memories and marvels in stone.</p>
